This a Project to be used to help an a QA course.

It is a basic setup of a Selenium Project with learning comments.

It uses https://www.saucedemo.com/ for testing and educational purposes.

In order to download the project you can use git clone https://github.com/filmihaylov/TestSelenium.git or download the source code thru the github ui

The project uses intelij Community which is a free version so I reccomend installing it https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=IIC

After installing it can open the projectd in it, it also helps you with installation of different jdks

The tests are located in "src/test/java/SeleniumTest.java" and if you click the right mouse button on the file you can see Run 'Selenium Test'

this will start the tests in Junit, which is a Java testing framework.
